# Folium Experiment

This started with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnU5qKTfYY&t=69s that shows making a choropleth map using unemployment data.  I changed it to use number of Recursers who are currently at Recurse.com.   The data is far from perfect (e.g. I added two ND people because I've seen them in meetings even though the data is not there).  Some people don't provide a location in the directory and that's (of course) ok.
